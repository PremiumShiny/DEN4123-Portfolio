DESC:   Program asks for user-defined values of n1, n2, and theta1
		checking whether a real solution exists for Snell's Law and
		thus, whether the ray experiences reflection or refraction.
		theta2 is then calculated and a plot is created showing both
		the incident and refracted (or reflected) ray.
		Handles catching of incorrect input types.
