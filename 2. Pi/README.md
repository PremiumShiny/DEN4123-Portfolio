# Pi
```
myPi  Estimates Pi.
   [ESTPI,N] = myPi(TOL) takes in a tolerance as an input argument and
   returns an estimate for pi and the amount of points as output arguments

   Note: Output argument names do not need to match.

   Syntax:  [estPi,N] = myPi(tol)

   Inputs:
      tol - A defined tolerance value; how close two consecutive values
      should be before the function terminates

   Outputs:
      estPi - An estimated value of Pi
      N - The amount of points tested

   Example:
      [pi,points] = myPi(1e-5)
